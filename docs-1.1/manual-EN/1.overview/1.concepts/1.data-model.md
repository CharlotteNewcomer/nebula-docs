# Graph Data Modeling

This guide is designed to walk you through the graph data modeling of **Nebula Graph**. Basic concepts of designing a graph data model will be introduced.

## Graph Space

**Graph Space** is a physically isolated space for different graph. It is similar to database in MySQL.

## Directed Property Graph

Nebula Graph stores data in directed property graphs. A directed property graph is a graph of vertices and edges that have a direction. It can be described as follows:

**G = < V, E, P<sub>V</sub>, P<sub>E</sub> >**

- **V** is the collection of vertices.
- **E** is the collection of edges.
- **P<sub>V</sub>** represents vertex properties.
- **P<sub>E</sub>** represents edge properties.

The following table describes a dataset `basketballplayer`. It has two types of vertices, i.e., **player** and **team**, and two types of edges, i.e., **serve** and **follow**.

| Type | Name | Property (data type) | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :---| :--- |
|tag| player | name （string） <br>age （int） | Represents players. |
|tag| team | name （string） | Represents teams. |
|edge type| serve |  start_year （int） <br> end_year （int） | Represents the behavior of players that connects players with teams.<br> The direction of the serve edges is from players to teams. |
|edge type| follow | degree （int） | Represents the behavior of players that connects players.<br> The direction of the follow edges is from one player to another player. |

## Vertices

Vertices are typically used to represent entities in the real world. In **Nebula Graph**, vertices are identified with vertex identifiers (i.e. VIDs). The `VID` must be unique in the graph space. In the preceding example, the graph contains eleven vertices.

## Tags

In **Nebula Graph**, vertex properties are clustered by **tags**. One vertex can have one or more tags. In the preceding example, the vertices have tags **player** and **team**.

## Edge

Edges are used to connect vertices. Each edge usually represents a relationship or a behavior between two vertices. In the preceding example, edges are _**serve**_ and _**follow**_.

## Edge Type

`Each edge` is an instance of an edge type. Our example uses _**serve**_ and _**follow**_ as edge types. Take edge _**serve**_ for example, in the preceding picture, vertex `101` (represents a **player**) is the source vertex and vertex `215` (represents a **team**) is the target vertex. We see that vertex `101` has an outgoing edge while vertex `215` has an incoming edge.

## Properties of Vertices and Edges

Both vertices and edges can have properties. Properties are described with key value pairs. In our example graph, we have used the properties `id`, `name` and `age` on **player**, `id` and `name` on **team**, and `degree` on **follow** edge.

## Edge Rank

Edge rank is an immutable user-assigned 64-bit signed integer. It affects the edge order of the same edge type between two vertices. The edge with a higher rank value comes first. When not specified, the default rank value is zero. The current sorting basis is "binary coding order", i.e. 0, 1, 2, ... 9223372036854775807, -9223372036854775808, -9223372036854775807, ..., -1.
In addition to an edge type, the edge between two vertices must have an edge rank. The edge rank is a 64-bit integer assigned by the user; if not specified, the edge rank defaults to 0.

An edge can be represented uniquely with the [source vertex, edge type, edge rank, destination vertex].

## Schema

In **Nebula Graph**, schema refers to the definition of properties (name, type, etc.). Like `MySQL`, **Nebula Graph** is a **strong typed** database. The name and data type of the properties should be determined before the data is written.
